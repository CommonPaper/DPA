# Data Processing Agreement

1. <span class="header_2">Processor and Subprocessor Relationships</span>

    1. <span class="header_3">Provider as Processor.</span>  In situations where <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> is a Controller of the Customer Personal Data, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will be deemed a Processor that is Processing Personal Data on behalf of <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span>.

    2. <span class="header_3">Provider as Subprocessor.</span>  In situations where <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> is a Processor of the Customer Personal Data, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will be deemed a Subprocessor of the Customer Personal Data.

2. <span class="header_2">Processing</span>

    1. <span class="header_3">Processing Details.</span>  Annex I(B) on the Cover Page describes the subject matter, nature, purpose, and duration of this Processing, as well as the <span class="keyterms_link">Categories of Personal Data</span> collected and <span class="keyterms_link">Categories of Data Subjects</span>.  

    2. <span class="header_3">Processing Instructions.</span>  <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> instructs <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> to Process Customer Personal Data: (a) to provide and maintain the Service; (b) as may be further specified through <span class="keyterms_link">Customer’s</span> use of the Service; (c) as documented in the <span class="keyterms_link">Agreement</span>; and (d) as documented in any other written instructions given by <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> and acknowledged by <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> about Processing Customer Personal Data under this DPA. <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will abide by these instructions unless prohibited from doing so by Applicable Laws. <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will immediately inform <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> if it is unable to follow the Processing instructions. <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> has given and will only give instructions that comply with Applicable Laws.

    3. <span class="header_3">Processing by Provider.</span>  <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will only Process Customer Personal Data in accordance with this DPA, including the details in the Cover Page. If <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> updates the Service to update existing or include new products, features, or functionality, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> may change the <span class="keyterms_link">Categories of Data Subjects</span>, <span class="keyterms_link">Categories of Personal Data</span>, <span class="keyterms_link">Special Category Data</span>, <span class="keyterms_link">Special Category Data Restrictions or Safeguards</span>, <span class="keyterms_link">Frequency of Transfer</span>, <span class="keyterms_link">Nature and Purpose of Processing</span>, and <span class="keyterms_link">Duration of Processing</span> as needed to reflect the updates by notifying <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> of the updates and changes.

    4. <span class="header_3">Customer Processing.</span>  Where <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> is a Processor and <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> is a Subprocessor, <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> will comply with all Applicable Laws that apply to <span class="keyterms_link">Customer’s</span> Processing of Customer Personal Data. <span class="keyterms_link">Customer’s</span> agreement with its Controller will similarly require <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> to comply with all Applicable Laws that apply to <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> as a Processor. In addition, <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> will comply with the Subprocessor requirements in <span class="keyterms_link">Customer’s</span> agreement with its Controller.

    5. <span class="header_3">Consent to Processing.</span>  <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> has complied with and will continue to comply with all Applicable Data Protection Laws concerning its provision of Customer Personal Data to <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> and/or the Service, including making all disclosures, obtaining all consents, providing adequate choice, and implementing relevant safeguards required under Applicable Data Protection Laws.

    6. <span class="header_3">Subprocessors.</span>

        a. <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will not provide, transfer, or hand over any Customer Personal Data to a Subprocessor unless <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> has approved the Subprocessor. The current list of <span class="keyterms_link">Approved Subprocessors</span> includes the identities of the Subprocessors, their country of location, and their anticipated Processing tasks. <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will inform <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> at least 10 business days in advance and in writing of any intended changes to the <span class="keyterms_link">Approved Subprocessors</span> whether by addition or replacement of a Subprocessor, which allows <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> to have enough time to object to the changes before the <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> begins using the new Subprocessor(s). <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will give <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> the information necessary to allow <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> to exercise its right to object to the change to <span class="keyterms_link">Approved Subprocessors</span>. <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> has 30 days after notice of a change to the <span class="keyterms_link">Approved Subprocessors</span> to object, otherwise <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> will be deemed to accept the changes. If <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> objects to the change within 30 days of notice, <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> and <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will cooperate in good faith to resolve <span class="keyterms_link">Customer’s</span> objection or concern.

        b. When engaging a Subprocessor, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will have a written agreement with the Subprocessor that ensures the Subprocessor only accesses and uses Customer Personal Data (i) to the extent required to perform the obligations subcontracted to it, and (ii) consistent with the terms of <span class="keyterms_link">Agreement</span>.

        c. If the GDPR applies to the Processing of Customer Personal Data, (i) the data protection obligations described in this DPA (as referred to in Article 28(3) of the GDPR, if applicable) are also imposed on the Subprocessor, and (ii) <span class="keyterms_link">Provider’s</span> agreement with the Subprocessor will incorporate these obligations, including details about how <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> and its Subprocessor will coordinate to respond to inquiries or requests about the Processing of Customer Personal Data. In addition, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will share, at <span class="keyterms_link">Customer’s</span> request, a copy of its agreements (including any amendments) with its Subprocessors. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> may redact the text of its agreement with its Subprocessor prior to sharing a copy.

        d. <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> remains fully liable for all obligations subcontracted to its Subprocessors, including the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors in Processing Customer Personal Data. <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will notify Customer of any failure by its Subprocessors to fulfill a material obligation about Customer Personal Data under the agreement between <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> and the Subprocessor.

3. <span class="header_2">Restricted Transfers</span>

    1. <span class="header_3">Authorization.</span>  <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> agrees that <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> may transfer Customer Personal Data outside the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other relevant geographic territory as necessary to provide the Service. If <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> transfers Customer Personal Data to a territory for which the European Commission or other relevant supervisory authority has not issued an adequacy decision, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will implement appropriate safeguards for the transfer of Customer Personal Data to that territory consistent with Applicable Data Protection Laws.

    2. <span class="header_3">Ex-EEA Transfers.</span>  <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> and <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> agree that if the GDPR protects the transfer of Customer Personal Data, the transfer is from <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> from within the EEA to <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> outside of the EEA, and the transfer is not governed by an adequacy decision made by the European Commission, then by entering into this DPA, <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> and <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> are deemed to have signed the EEA SCCs and their Annexes, which are incorporated by reference. Any such transfer is made pursuant to the EEA SCCs, which are completed as follows:

        a. Module Two (Controller to Processor) of the EEA SCCs apply when <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> is a Controller and <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> is Processing Customer Personal Data for <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> as a Processor.

        b. Module Three (Processor to Sub-Processor) of the EEA SCCs apply when <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> is a Processor and <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> is Processing Customer Personal Data on behalf of <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> as a Subprocessor.

        c. For each module, the following applies (when applicable):    

            i. The optional docking clause in Clause 7 does not apply;

            ii. In Clause 9, Option 2 (general written authorization) applies, and the minimum time period for prior notice of Subprocessor changes is 10 business days;

            iii. In Clause 11, the optional language does not apply;

            iv. All square brackets in Clause 13 are removed;

            v. In Clause 17 (Option 1), the EEA SCCs will be governed by the laws of <span class="keyterms_link">Governing Member State</span>;

            vi. In Clause 18(b), disputes will be resolved in the courts of the <span class="keyterms_link">Governing Member State</span>; and

            vii. The Cover Page to this DPA contains the information required in Annex I, Annex II, and Annex III of the EEA SCCs.

    3. <span class="header_3">Ex-UK Transfers.</span>  <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> and <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> agree that if the UK GDPR protects the transfer of Customer Personal Data, the transfer is from <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> from within the United Kingdom to <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> outside of the United Kingdom, and the transfer is not governed by an adequacy decision made by the United Kingdom Secretary of State, then by entering into this DPA, <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> and <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> are deemed to have signed the UK Addendum and their Annexes, which are incorporated by reference. Any such transfer is made pursuant to the UK Addendum, which is completed as follows:

        a. Section 3.2 of this DPA contains the information required in Table 2 of the UK Addendum.

        b. Table 4 of the UK Addendum is modified as follows: Neither party may end the UK Addendum as set out in Section 19 of the UK Addendum; to the extent ICO issues a revised Approved Addendum under Section ‎18 of the UK Addendum, the parties will work in good faith to revise this DPA accordingly.

        c. The Cover Page contains the information required by Annex 1A, Annex 1B, Annex II, and Annex III of the UK Addendum.

    4. <span class="header_3">Other International Transfers.</span>  For Personal Data transfers where Swiss law (and not the law in any EEA member state or the United Kingdom) applies to the international nature of the transfer, references to the GDPR in Clause 4 of the EEA SCCs are, to the extent legally required, amended to refer to the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act or its successor instead, and the concept of supervisory authority will include the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.

4. <span class="header_2">Security Incident Response</span>

    1. Upon becoming aware of any Security Incident, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will: (a) notify <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> without undue delay when feasible, but no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the Security Incident; (b) provide timely information about the Security Incident as it becomes known or as is reasonably requested by <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span>; and (c) promptly take reasonable steps to contain and investigate the Security Incident. <span class="keyterms_link">Provider’s</span> notification of or response to a Security Incident as required by this DPA will not be construed as an acknowledgment by <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> of any fault or liability for the Security Incident.

5. <span class="header_2">Audit & Reports</span>

    1. <span class="header_3">Audit Rights.</span>  <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will give <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate its compliance with this DPA and <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections by <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span>, to assess <span class="keyterms_link">Provider’s</span> compliance with this DPA. However, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> may restrict access to data or information if <span class="keyterms_link">Customer’s</span> access to the information would negatively impact <span class="keyterms_link">Provider’s</span> intellectual property rights, confidentiality obligations, or other obligations under Applicable Laws. <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> acknowledges and agrees that it will only exercise its audit rights under this DPA and any audit rights granted by Applicable Data Protection Laws by instructing <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> to comply with the reporting and due diligence requirements below. <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will maintain records of its compliance with this DPA for 3 years after the DPA ends.

    2. <span class="header_3">Security Reports.</span>  <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> acknowledges that <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> is regularly audited against the standards defined in the <span class="keyterms_link">Security Policy</span> by independent third-party auditors. Upon written request, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will give <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span>, on a confidential basis, a summary copy of its then-current Report so that <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> can verify <span class="keyterms_link">Provider’s</span> compliance with the standards defined in the <span class="keyterms_link">Security Policy</span>.

    3. <span class="header_3">Security Due Diligence.</span>  In addition to the Report, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will respond to reasonable requests for information made by <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> to confirm <span class="keyterms_link">Provider’s</span> compliance with this DPA, including responses to information security, due diligence, and audit questionnaires, or by giving additional information about its information security program. All such requests must be in writing and made to the <span class="keyterms_link">Provider Security Contact</span> and may only be made once a year.

6. <span class="header_2">Coordination & Cooperation</span>

    1. <span class="header_3">Response to Inquiries.</span>  If <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> receives any inquiry or request from anyone else about the Processing of Customer Personal Data, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will notify <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> about the request and <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will not respond to the request without <span class="keyterms_link">Customer’s</span> prior consent. Examples of these kinds of inquiries and requests include a judicial or administrative or regulatory agency order about Customer Personal Data where notifying <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> is not prohibited by Applicable Law, or a request from a data subject. If allowed by Applicable Law, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will follow <span class="keyterms_link">Customer’s</span> reasonable instructions about these requests, including providing status updates and other information reasonably requested by <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span>. If a data subject makes a valid request under Applicable Data Protection Laws to delete or opt out of <span class="keyterms_link">Customer’s</span> giving of Customer Personal Data to <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span>, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will assist <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> in fulfilling the request according to the Applicable Data Protection Law. <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance to <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span>, at <span class="keyterms_link">Customer’s</span> expense, in any legal response or other procedural action taken by <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> in response to a third-party request about <span class="keyterms_link">Provider’s</span> Processing of Customer Personal Data under this DPA.

    2. <span class="header_3">DPIAs and DTIAs.</span>  If required by Applicable Data Protection Laws, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will reasonably assist <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> in conducting any mandated data protection impact assessments or data transfer impact assessments and consultations with relevant data protection authorities, taking into consideration the nature of the Processing and Customer Personal Data.

7. <span class="header_2">Deletion of Customer Personal Data</span>

    1. <span class="header_3">Deletion by Customer.</span>  <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will enable <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> to delete Customer Personal Data in a manner consistent with the functionality of the Services. <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will comply with this instruction as soon as reasonably practicable except where further storage of Customer Personal Data is required by Applicable Law.

    2. <span class="header_3">Deletion at DPA Expiration.</span>

        a. After the DPA expires, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will return or delete Customer Personal Data at <span class="keyterms_link">Customer’s</span> instruction unless further storage of Customer Personal Data is required or authorized by Applicable Law. If return or destruction is impracticable or prohibited by Applicable Laws, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will make reasonable efforts to prevent additional Processing of Customer Personal Data and will continue to protect the Customer Personal Data remaining in its possession, custody, or control. For example, Applicable Laws may require <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> to continue hosting or Processing Customer Personal Data.

        b. If <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> and <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> have entered the EEA SCCs or the UK Addendum as part of this DPA, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will only give <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> the certification of deletion of Personal Data described in Clause 8.1(d) and Clause 8.5 of the EEA SCCs if <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> asks for one.

8. <span class="header_2">Limitation of Liability</span>

    1. <span class="header_3">Liability Caps and Damages Waiver.</span>  **To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Data Protection Laws, each party’s total cumulative liability to the other party arising out of or related to this DPA will be subject to the waivers, exclusions, and limitations of liability stated in the <span class="keyterms_link">Agreement</span>.**

    2. <span class="header_3">Related-Party Claims.</span>  **Any claims made against <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> or its Affiliates arising out of or related to this DPA may only be brought by the <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> entity that is a party to the <span class="keyterms_link">Agreement</span>.**

    3. <span class="header_3">Exceptions.</span>  This DPA does not limit any liability to an individual about the individual’s data protection rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws. In addition, this DPA does not limit any liability between the parties for violations of the EEA SCCs or UK Addendum.

9. <span class="header_2">Conflicts Between Documents</span>

    1. This DPA forms part of and supplements the Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between this DPA, the <span class="keyterms_link">Agreement</span>, or any of their parts, the part listed earlier will control over the part listed later for that inconsistency: (1) the EEA SCCs or the UK Addendum, (2) this DPA, and then (3) the <span class="keyterms_link">Agreement</span>.

10. <span class="header_2">Term of Agreement</span>

However, <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> and <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> will each remain subject to the obligations in this DPA and Applicable Data Protection Laws until <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> stops transferring Customer Personal Data to <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> and <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> stops Processing Customer Personal Data.
